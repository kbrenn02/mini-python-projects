Similar to project 1, make a coffee machine exchange that is run in the terminal that meets the following requirements:
1. Ask user what they would like 
2. Turn off Coffee Machine 
3. Print report that shows current resource values (this will probably be a separate function) doesn't include $
4. Check if there are sufficient resources
5. Process coins (this will probably be a separate function)
6. Check if the transaction was successful
7. Make coffee.

The difference with this coffee machine is that I am moving out of 1 document that contains all the functions and am instead creating classes that are called in a main file.

To run the coffee machine, run `python3 main.py` after navigating into the coffee machine project.
